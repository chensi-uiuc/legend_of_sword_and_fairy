## Background Story
You are a warrior in an ancient world. Oneday when you were shopping on the street with your beloved wife, a Peng (giant bird that transforms from a giant fish in Chinese mythology) lifted you up, carried you flying for thousands of miles into a mysterious land, and finally dropped you in the center of a maze composed of three layers of "Bagua Diagram".

You looked around and find a notice board that says "Welcome to the World of Sword and Fairy. Find the King of Devil in the maze in front of you and kill him to return to your normal life. Be careful not tp get killed during the hunt!"

## Characters
* King of Devil
A dark lord living in the maze that likes your brain. You could hear his heavy steps when he is in the next room of yours.

* Squash Zombies
Four of them live in the maze that also like your juicy brain. You could smell the fragarance of them when they are right next to your room. But be careful, a simple encounter with one of them would make you lose and become their dinner.

* Stonehenge Portals
There are two stonehenge portals in the maze that could transfer to to another room once you step on them. After the transfer they would move to another random place.
